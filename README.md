## Introduction
Customer churn is a major concern for financial institutions. Approximately **17% of customers** stop using their credit cards, leading to **decreased revenue** and **increased acquisition costs**. This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn using **data-driven insights** to help retain valuable customers.

## Business Understanding
### Background
The bank aims to **reduce the customer churn rate from 16%** by identifying high-risk customers and implementing **proactive retention strategies**.

### SMART Analysis
**Specific:** Reduce customer churn by predicting high-risk customers.  
**Measurable:** Decrease churn by **5-10%** after implementing preventive actions.  
**Achievable:** Offer **automatic credit limit increases** for active users with **50+ transactions in 12 months**.  
**Relevant:** Lower churn → **Higher bank profitability**.  
**Time-Bound:** Achieve within **3 months** to implement prevention strategies.  

### Problem Statement
The main goal is to reduce churn by **5-10%** through predictive model-based strategies. One proposed strategy is to **increase credit limits automatically** for customers with **50+ transactions in the last 12 months**.

### Problem Breakdown (5W+1H)
**WHAT:** What causes churn to reach **16%**?  
**WHY:** Why is **reducing churn** important for the bank?
